Until the Signal team gets around to implementing this, here's a quick workaround:


1. Select View from the menu, then Toggle Developer Tools.
2. In the /Elements tab/, expand the /body tag/, then the /div tag/ of class inbox index.
3. Click on the div tag of class ~gutter inactive~.
4. In the Styles tab, which is usually underneath, find the gutter class.
5. Change the width parameter to 75px (the size may vary on your screen)
6. Enjoy!
7. The only downside is you'll have to repeat these steps every time you relaunch Signal.

(note: make sure you use the correct ~body~ parameter. the correct one has 320px as default)

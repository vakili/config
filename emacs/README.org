Note: I am not backing up my emacs config at the moment, since it is a fairly vanilla Spacemacs+layers setup.
* Known issues
** Annoying ~completion-at-point~ in ~#+begin_src bash~
   Here is how to reproduce. Move point to the line below, then hit ~o~.
   #+begin_src bash
   #+end_src
   
   Issue description: a ~helm~ window comes up (labelled ~helm-completion-at-point~) which provides useless completion.
   This also occurs when pressing ~Tab~ in insert mode.
*** Possible solution
  Selectively disable ~helm-completion-at-point~ by running
  #+begin_src lisp
    (setq helm-mode-handle-completion-in-region nil
  #+end_src
  (to evaluate, ~M-x lisp eval~)
